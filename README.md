Orchestrator server for invocation of detectors on text generation input and output [name subject to change]

![LLM Orchestration diagram](docs/architecture/images/llm_detector_orchestration.png "Orchestr8 Diagram")

## Getting Started

Make sure Rust and Cargo are [installed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

To build and install the binary locally:
```sh
cargo install --path .
```

To run the server locally:
```sh
cargo run --bin fms-guardrails-orchestr8
```

To run tests:
```sh
cargo test
```

To build documenation:
```sh
cargo doc
```

If you wish to contribute to the project, make sure you install pre-commit hooks to have automated checks for Rust before every commit (requires [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to be installed in the system).

```
# You can skip this step if you already have it installed.
pip install pre-commit
```

Once you have pre-commit installed, run the following command on the project folder to install the pre-commit hooks:
```
pre-commit install
```
